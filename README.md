# 🎬 Movie Recommender System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using Python and machine learning techniques. It provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences using content-based filtering.

📌 Features
Recommend movies based on content similarity.

Uses cosine similarity to measure closeness between movies.

Simple and interactive interface using Jupyter Notebook.

Based on metadata like genres, keywords, overview, cast, and crew.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas

Numpy

Scikit-learn

NLTK (for optional NLP tasks)

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
The project uses the TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset from Kaggle which includes:

tmdb_5000_movies.csv

tmdb_5000_credits.csv

Make sure these datasets are available in the working directory.

⚙️ How It Works
Data is loaded and merged from the two CSV files.

Important features like genres, cast, crew, keywords, overview are extracted and processed.

Text data is cleaned and combined into a "tag" feature.

Vectorization is done using CountVectorizer.

Cosine similarity is computed between movies.

Based on the user input, the most similar movies are recommended.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Place the dataset files in the same directory.

Open movie recommender system.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any IDE.

Run the cells sequentially.

Use recommend('Movie Title') to get suggestions.

python
Copy
Edit
recommend('Avatar')
📈 Example Output
For the movie "The Dark Knight", the system might recommend:

The Dark Knight Rises

Batman Begins

Man of Steel

... etc.

📌 Future Improvements
Add collaborative filtering or hybrid model

Integrate with a web interface using Flask or Streamlit

Include movie posters and metadata in recommendations
